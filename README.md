ðŸ“„ Project Description (Detailed Version)
Project Title:
Student Registration Form using React, Formik, and Yup

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to create a responsive, user-friendly student registration form using modern web technologies. The form allows users to input their personal information and ensures that the data is valid before submission.

Technologies Used:
Technology	Purpose
React JS	For building the user interface and managing component state
Formik	For handling form state, managing input values, and submission
Yup	For schema-based form validation
CSS	For designing and styling the form interface

Form Fields:
The form collects the following data from the user:

Full Name (Text input)

Email (Email input with format validation)

Password (Hidden input, minimum 6 characters)

Grade (Dropdown selection with options: A, B, C, D, F)

Gender (Radio buttons: Male, Female, Other)

Functionality and Features:
Formik Integration:

Handles all input fields using <Field> elements.

Manages form submission and state changes without writing extra logic.

Yup Validation Schema:

Ensures fields are filled correctly:

Name is required

Email must be valid

Password must be at least 6 characters

Grade and Gender must be selected

Error messages are shown directly under the fields.

React useState Hook:

Used to store the submitted form data.

After submission, the data is saved and the form is reset.

Custom Styling (CSS):

Clean and professional layout.

Mobile-responsive design using media queries.

Styled form elements (inputs, buttons, etc.) for better UX.

User Feedback:

Real-time validation and error messages.

After submission, data can be optionally displayed or logged.

Workflow:
The user fills out the form.

Formik tracks the input values.

On submission, Yup checks for errors.

If there are errors:

They are displayed next to the respective fields.

If all values are valid:

The data is saved.

The form is cleared.

A message or summary may be shown to the user.

Key Benefits:
Reduces code complexity by using Formik and Yup.

Provides real-time feedback to users through validation.

Creates a reusable form component in React.

Ensures a smooth and professional user experience.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how React, Formik, and Yup can work together to build a modern, responsive, and fully validated registration form. It highlights best practices for building forms in React and shows how using the right libraries can simplify development, improve usability, and ensure data accuracy.
